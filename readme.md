This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I'm Tomasz Wirkus and this project coded in React is my personal website. It's intended for potential employers who would like to become familiar with my projects and skills.

#### Things I learned during that project

Due the fact, this website is propably the first meeting with my programming skills for potential employers, I treat it exceptionally and and from time to time make several changes to it. First version of this project I started coding around August 2019 in React v15, since then, the design has turned 180 degrees at least twice. Around January I finally updated it to React v16. Even though it's not very complex project, its visual side took me a lot of time.

Things I learned during that project:

- That is my first self-coded project using React, so I learned a lot of basics from it
- Creating simple Node.js server
- Publishing to Heroku
- In Reactv15 I needed to learn and create babel and webpack configuration by my own
- Cool css animations (all animations in that project comes straight from css)
- Formspree setup
- ReactModal
